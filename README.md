### UCI-HAR
#### To complete the analysis you should do the following:
* Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each feature.  From the features.txt data, keep the columns that match the pattern either "mean" or "std".
* Use activity names ('WALKING', 'WALKING_UPSTAIRS', 'WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS', SITTING', 'STANDING', 'LAYING') to label the activities in the y_train.txt and y_test.txt.
* Set names for each variable from features.txt to the data set created in the second step. 
* Create tidy data set (final.txt) from the data on the previous step with the calculated average for each activity and subject. Add to columns with the subject number and activity name, group data set by them, and apply mean function for all the variables.
